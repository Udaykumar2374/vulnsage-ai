Sample Bug Bounty Report

Title: Stored XSS in Comment Section

Summary:
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript in the blog comment section. The script executes when other users visit the post.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in as a normal user.
2. Go to any blog post and leave a comment with the payload:
   <script>alert("XSS")</script>
3. View the comment as another user â€” the alert triggers.

Impact:
- Stored XSS can lead to session hijacking, CSRF, phishing, and data exfiltration.
- Users can be attacked without interaction.

Affected Endpoint:
POST /blog/{id}/comment

Suggested Fix:
- Sanitize HTML input.
- Use a JavaScript escaping library.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

Severity: High
